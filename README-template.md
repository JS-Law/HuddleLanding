## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

My most important take away from this project is working with SVGs and how their sizing is handled when it becomes a flex item. I learned that I need to make a greater effort on focusing on my semantic HTML. Not all elements can be divs.  

### Continued development

In the next few projects, I will focus on implementing more semantic HTML and utilizing less CSS. I definitely feel as if some of my styles are redundant and could have been implemented in a way that applies to many elements at the same time.
